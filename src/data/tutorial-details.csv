Crowdsourcing beyond annotation,"Crowdsourcing from non-experts is one of the most common approaches to collecting data and annotations in NLP. It has been applied to a plethora of tasks, including question answering, instruction following, visual reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. Even though it is such a fundamental tool, crowdsourcing use is largely guided by common practices and the personal experience of researchers. Developing a theory of crowdsourcing use for practical language problems remains an open challenge. However, there are various principles and practices that have proven effective in generating high quality and diverse data. The goal of this tutorial is to expose NLP researchers to such data collection crowdsourcing methods and principles through a detailed discussion of a diverse set of case studies.","Broadly speaking, machine reasoning research aims to build AI systems that can draw new conclusions or solve unseen problems from what they are told (i.e. environment) and already know (i.e. knowledge) by using inference techniques such as induction and deduction. In this tutorial, we will (1) review definitions, key components and characteristics of machine reasoning; (2) introduce typical machine reasoning frameworks, including symbolic reasoning, statistical relational learning, neural-symbolic reasoning and environment-based reasoning; (3) talk about necessary technologies of applying machine reasoning in NLP scenarios, including natural language understanding (NLU), human-computer interaction (HCI), natural language generation (NLG) and model interpretation; (4) show examples of applying machine reasoning techniques in real-world applications; (5) summarize challenges of current methods and discuss possible future directions.",,
Financial opinion mining,"In this tutorial, we disassemble a financial opinion into 12 components. This tutorial starts by introducing the components one by one and introduces the related studies from both NLP technical aspects and the real-world applications. Besides, in the FinTech trend, financial service gets much attention from the financial industry. However, few studies discuss the opinion toward financial service. In this tutorial, we will also introduce this kind of opinion and provide a comparison with the opinion of investors and customer's opinions in other industries. Several unexplored research questions will be proposed. The audiences of this tutorial will gain an overview of financial opinion mining and figure out their research directions based on the proposed research agenda.","Understanding spatial language is important in many real-world applications. This includes applications of language grounding, navigation, visual question answering, and more generic human-machine interaction and dialogue systems. In many of such downstream tasks, explicit representation of spatial concepts and relationships can improve the capabilities of machine learning models in reasoning and deep language understanding. In this tutorial, we overview the cutting-edge research results and existing challenges related to spatial language understanding including semantic annotations,  existing corpora, symbolic and sub-symbolic representations, qualitative spatial reasoning, spatial common sense, deep and structured learning models.  We discuss the recent results on the above-mentioned applications --that need spatial language learning and reasoning -- and highlight the research gaps and future directions.

Knowledge-enriched NLG,"Knowledge-enriched text generation poses unique challenges in modeling and learning, driving active research in several core directions, ranging from integrated modeling of neural representations and symbolic information in the sequential/hierarchical/graphical structures, learning without direct supervisions due to the cost of structured annotation, efficient optimization and inference with massive and global constraints, to language grounding on multiple modalities, and generative reasoning with implicit commonsense knowledge and background knowledge. In this tutorial we will present a roadmap to line up the state-of-the-art methods to tackle these challenges on this cutting-edge problem. We will dive deep into various technical components: how to represent knowledge, how to feed knowledge into a generation model, how to evaluate generation results, and what are the remaining challenges?","This tutorial presents an overview of the current state-of-the-art in neural network architectures, and how they shaped recent research directions in text generation.",,
Multi-domain multilingual QA,"Question answering (QA) is one of the most challenging and impactful tasks in natural language processing. Most research in QA and tutorials, however, has focused on the open-domain or monolingual setting while most real-world applications deal with specific domains or languages. In this tutorial, we attempt to bridge this gap. Firstly, we introduce standard benchmarks in multi-domain and multilingual QA. In both scenarios, we discuss state-of-the-art approaches that achieve impressive performance by either zero-shot learning or out-of-the-box training on open (and closed)-domain QA systems. Finally, we will present open research problems that this new research agenda poses such as multi-task learning, cross-lingual transfer learning, domain adaptation and training large scale pre-trained multilingual language models.","Simultaneous translation, which performs translation concurrently with the source speech, is widely useful in many scenarios such as international conferences, negotiations, press releases, legal proceedings, and medicine. This problem has long been considered one of the hardest problems in AI and one of its holy grails.
Recently, with rapid improvements in machine translation, speech recognition, and speech synthesis, there has been exciting progress towards simultaneous translation. This tutorial will focus on the design and evaluation of policies for simultaneous translation, to leave attendees with a deep technical understanding of the history, the recent advances, and the remaining challenges in this field.",,
Robustness and adversarial examples in NLP,"Recent studies show that many NLP systems are sensitive and vulnerable to a small perturbation of inputs and do not generalize well across different datasets. This lack of robustness derails the use of NLP systems in real-world applications. This tutorial aims at bringing awareness of practical concerns about NLP robustness. It targets NLP researchers and practitioners who are interested in building reliable NLP systems. In particular, we will review recent studies on analyzing the weakness of NLP systems when facing adversarial inputs and data with a distribution shift. We will provide the audience with a holistic view of 1) how to use adversarial examples to examine the weakness of NLP models and facilitate debugging; 2) how to enhance the robustness of existing NLP models and defense against adversarial inputs; and 3) how the consideration of robustness affects the real-world NLP applications used in our daily lives. We will conclude the tutorial by outlining future research directions in this area.","Scale has played a central role in the rapid progress natural language processing has enjoyed in recent years. While benchmarks are dominated by ever larger models, efficient hardware use is critical for their widespread adoption and further progress in the field. In this cutting-edge tutorial, we will recapitulate the state-of-the-art in natural language processing with scale in perspective. After establishing these foundations, we will cover a wide range of techniques for improving efficiency, including knowledge distillation, quantization, pruning, more efficient architectures, along with case studies and practical implementation tricks.",,
Syntax in end-to-end NLP,"This tutorial surveys the latest technical progress of syntactic parsing and the role of syntax in end-to-end natural language processing (NLP) tasks, in which semantic role labeling (SRL) and machine translation (MT) are the representative NLP tasks that have always been beneficial from informative syntactic clues since a long time ago, though the advance from end-to-end deep learning models shows new results. In this tutorial, we will first introduce the background and the latest progress of syntactic parsing and SRL/NMT. Then, we will summarize the key evidence about the syntactic impacts over these two concerning tasks, and explore the behind reasons from both computational and linguistic background.","Neural NLP models fail in counterintuitive ways and are opaque in their decision-making process. This tutorial will describe methods for interpreting the predictions of complex NLP models. We will first situate example-specific interpretations in the context of other ways to understand models (e.g., probing, dataset analyses). Next, we will present a thorough study of example-specific interpretations, including saliency maps, input perturbations, and influence functions. Alongside these descriptions, we will walk through easy-to-use source code that creates and visualizes interpretations for a diverse set of tasks. We will conclude with a discussion of open problems in the field.",,
