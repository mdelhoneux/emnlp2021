EMNLP 2021 will take place from the 7th to the 11th of November 2021, hopefully in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, but possibly online depending on the development of the covid situation.  
The organizing committee can be found [here](https://2021.emnlp.org/organizers).  
The paper submission deadline is expected to be late May or early June, watch this space for further updates.
