    User Profile FAQs
---


Following EMNLP 2020, we will use the Global Profile and the Reviewer Survey Form in the User Profile for conflict of interest (COI) detection as well as better match reviewers with papers. If you have filled your Global Profile before, please check/update it as there are a few new fields. 

This FAQ shows how to update your global and user profile at softconf. Bear in mind that your data is processed by an automatic system, not a human, hence the need to follow the instructions carefully. 

## Getting to your Global Profile
As a reminder, you can access your Global Profile by going here first:
<https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2021/super/scmd.cgi?ucmd=main>

If that link does not work, you can go to:
<https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2021/papers/>  
Once you log into your START account, click “Go to the Global Profile”, then choose “Update Profile”.

### Affiliations Text Box
You should create a list of domains here as specified and illustrated in the Profile instructions. List one on each line without punctuation. Suppose that you are currently working at Google, and moved there from Carnegie Mellon last year. Then enter *google.com* on one line, and *cmu.edu* on the next line. Add as many lines as necessary.

### Semantic Scholar ID
This is the most important field in your profile and is used to find your recent papers for automatic COI against co-authors and for reviewer-paper matching. Please find your semantic scholar webpage (search your name at http://semanticscholar.org) and place the URL (which should look like *`https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/<name>/<number>`*) in this text box. Make sure not to include any commas or semicolons.
* If you have a semantic scholar page, but it’s mixed with someone else’s papers, that’s fine. Please list that URL. But it’s a good idea in general to curate your semantic scholar so it only reflects your work - do that later and update the profile URL if necessary thereafter. Having other papers there won’t impact the processes in EMNLP 2021.
* If you have never published before, you will not have a semantic scholar page, and thus list n/a in the text box.
* If you have published before but Semantic Scholar does not have a page for you (it happens sometimes), you have to create a page. Updates to Semantic Scholar can take several days so, in the meantime, please list n/a. Once the semantic scholar page is available, update the Global Profile with the URL.

### Google Scholar ID
Find your Google scholar webpage (search your name at http://scholar.google.com/) and place the URL (which should look like *`https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XXXXXXXX`*) in this text box. If you have never published before, you will not have a Google scholar page, and thus list n/a in the text box.

### COI Text Box
In this field you enter the semantic scholar URLs of researchers who you have or currently collaborate with but do not have any publications with. Note that there should be one URL per line without any punctuation.

### Year of PhD Graduation
This field was changed recently and is now split into: Highest Degree Earned (or to be earned); and Year Awarded (to be awarded). For instance, if you have a PhD or are enrolled in PhD study, please enter “PhD” in the first field, and your date of (expected) completion in the latter. If you have no degree and are not studying for a degree, please enter ‘n/a’ in both fields.

### Secondary Email
This is important to list in case we or future program chairs need to get in touch with you about reviews or other conference related duties. It should not be the same as your Primary Email.


## Reviewer Survey Form
You can access your Reviewer Survey Form by going to your Account profile first:
<https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2021/papers/user/scmd.cgi?scmd=updateProfile>

If that link does not work, you can go to:
<https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2021/papers/>  
Once you log into your START account, click “Update Profile”.

Please select the areas (tracks) that you would like to serve as a reviewer below. You will be assigned to one of your preferred tracks and are expected to review up to 6 papers (including both long and short papers). If you need reduced load, please choose from the drop-down list. 

Filling the reviewer survey form does not necessarily mean you will become a reviewer of EMNLP 2021. Program Chairs and Senior Area Chairs will make the decision.

*Most of the text above comes from an [EMNLP 2020 blog post on reviewer profiles](https://2020.emnlp.org/blog/2020-05-09-fixing-reviewer-profiles) and an [ACL 2021 Global Profile FAQ](https://2021.aclweb.org/blog/global-profile-faqs/) on the same topic.*
