    Submission FAQ
---

### **Q1: Does the anonymity deadline of April 17, 2021 refer to the submission deadline or publication deadline for an arXiv submission?**  
For arXiv submissions, April 17 11:59pm UTC-12h (anywhere on earth) is the submission deadline. For other non-anonymized versions, it is the deadline when such a version becomes public. 

### **Q2: We will post an arXiv preprint prior to the anonymity period, and we will not update / advertise it after anonymity begins. May we introduce upgrades to the associated web demo and the related GitHub repo during the anonymity period if we do not announce these upgrades in any way?**  
So long as you don't update your arXiv preprint during the anonymity period, you won't be considered as violating the anonymity policy. That is, you can still update your web demo and a GitHub repo after anonymity begins.

### **Q3: Can we present the submitted work in an invited talk during the anonymity period?**  
Yes. However, If the invited talk is before August 25 (the notification date of EMNLP 2021) and if the abstract/content of the invited talk will be available on the Web, please ensure that the wording of that (e.g., talk title and abstract) will be different from EMNLP submissions so that one cannot be very certain that the speaker is an author of the submissions.

### **Q4: Do I need to submit an abstract by May 10, 2021?**  
Yes. We require authors to submit an abstract one week before the full-paper deadline in order to prepare for the review cycle. If you donâ€™t submit an abstract by that date, you will not be able to submit the full paper by the May 17, 2021 deadline.

### **Q5: Can we change the title, abstract or the authors when submitting the full paper?**  
You should not change the author names, author order and the subject area after the abstract submission deadline. This information will be used to assign submissions to tracks and run conflict-of-interest checks. However, you can change the paper type and make minor changes to the title and the abstract.

### **Q6: Can we submit a survey-like paper to EMNLP 2021?**  
You are welcomed to submit a survey paper to EMNLP, provided that the survey makes a meaningful contribution to the research literature (such as new conclusions to draw, gaps in the current research, potential future research directions, etc.)

### **Q7: Can we submit a paper based on work reported previously in a talk?**  
You are most welcome to submit your work to EMNLP 2021 so long as the talk or the previous venue you submitted work to does not have a formal proceedings, with an ISBN/ISSN/DOI or similar.

### **Q8: Can we submit EMNLP papers to a non-archival workshop? The workshop will not have formal published proceedings, but will provide links to accepted papers.**  
If your workshop paper is published online between April 17 and August 25, then you would violate our anonymity policy. Otherwise, it is OK.

### **Q9: Can we append one page of appendix at the end of our full paper?**  
There's a field on the submission form for your appendix, so please submit it this way. The reviewers can still see this, and it's just presented in a separate link to the paper itself. They are not required to read this, but if you refer to it from the paper then they are likely to look for this file.

### **Q10: We will introduce a new dataset in our EMNLP submission. We will include in the paper a URL linking to our dataset. Can we only upload a subset of our data?**  
You may want to upload your dataset as a .zip archive, rather than a link. This will remain private between the reviewers & the relevant chairs, but not the wider world. It is our policy that reviewers must not steal data or ideas that they learn through the review process. If you feel nervous, then just upload a small sample, which is sufficient for reviewers to understand the resource.

### **Q11: Will there be Findings of EMNLP this year?**  
Yes, we will continue accepting a portion of the submitted papers in *Findings of EMNLP*, [introduced in EMNLP 2020](https://2020.emnlp.org/blog/2020-04-19-findings-of-emnlp/).

### **Q12: How is ethics review handled?**  
Please refer to the [Ethics Policy](/call-for-papers#ethics-policy) section of call for papers and [Ethics FAQ](/call-for-papers/ethics-faq).

### **Q13: Do all authors have to have user profiles and global profiles?**  
Please make sure you and your co-authors have filled out the user profile. This includes updating your Global User Information (which includes conflicts of interest and Semantic Scholar ID, Google Scholar ID, among other things), in addition to the conference profile Information.
