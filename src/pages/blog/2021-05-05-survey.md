EMNLP 2021 is planned to be a hybrid event in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, with both on-site and fully virtual participation possible. As this will be the first hybrid \*ACL event, the format will be experimental, and to optimize the experience for our members, we are asking all ACL members potentially interested in participating in EMNLP 2021 to complete the survey found at: <https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=9028kaqAQ0OMdrEjlJf7WY4w_ivCkJNKnHxP2pxjk6pUOTBYQjRLTUlDTkRWODIyVVFLNE9XUUFCWi4u>

If you plan to attend the EMNLP 2021 conference, please complete this short survey by May 10, 2021. Your answers are not binding, but your best estimates are very important to successful conference planning.

Thank you for your input to make EMNLP 2021 a success !
