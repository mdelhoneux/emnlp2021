EMNLP 2021 is currently officially scheduled to be held in hybrid mode, online and in Punta Cana, in the Dominican Republic. We have a 2-tier registration form: one will ask if you plan to attend virtually only and this answer will present a virtual registration form and if answering that you plan to attend in-person, a separate in-person registration form will be presented.  
<br>
We made a great effort to provide an excellent program while keeping registration fees as low as possible for both the virtual meeting and, especially, for the in-person meeting.
The fees are:

*Reminder*: It is ACL’s policy that at least one author of each accepted paper (including Findings papers) must register for the conference.  

In an effort to provide a safer in-person conference experience, we will require that in-person conference attendees be vaccinated against COVID-19 in a very high percentage of cases (and tested multiple times if vaccination is unavailable to them or contraindicated).  Also, \*all\* attendees will be tested for COVID-19 shortly before departure for the conference (see below). The convention center will be used exclusively by EMNLP, and to reduce external exposures we are asking everyone to stay in the very-good-value all-inclusive adjacent conference resort (details and heavily discounted prices [here](/venue#accomodation)). There is open-air access from the resort's hotel rooms to the nearby convention center, there are multiple open-air socialization spaces in the convention center, and the major celebratory social event will be fully outdoors on the beach. Together we are working to provide additional environmental protections for in-person attendees. Additional information regarding protocols and on-site participation requirements will be available here as we have more details.

To complete your registration IF you are planning to attend the conference on-site, please submit proof of vaccination before October 31st (or before arrival for late/onsite registration), and ALSO before arrival submit the formal results of a PCR or rapid antigen COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours before departure for the conference, BOTH either by email (to acl.PatKirby@gmail.com) or by fax (to +1-570-476-8006), with the Subject lines "VACCINATION + your full name" or "COVID-TEST + your full name".  For questions, or if vaccination against COVID-19 is either contraindicated for you or unavailable in your country/region, please contact Priscilla Rasmussen at acl.rasmussen@gmail.com.  Additional details, and links to providers of inexpensive pre-departure COVID-19 test options in multiple countries will be available here.  

## ACL Membership

The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a current (CY 2021) ACL member. So, in addition to the registration fee, each Regular will add $100 membership fee to their registration and each Student will add $50 membership fee to their registration if not already a 2021 paid member. ACL membership is for the entire calendar year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL and TACL Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in the same year without paying membership again. Membership also entitles you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts on publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and related conferences, workshops, and journal calls of interest to the community.

## Reduced Rate Memberships
The ACL offers a discount to members from developing countries. We hope this discount will allow for more people from these countries to become a part of the ACL and enjoy its benefits. To be able to benefit from reduced rate memberships, you need to become a member through the ACL Member Portal. You can then register for the conference as a current member. For more information follow this link: <https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/membership-fees>

## Letter of Invitation Requests and Visa Information

If a letter of invitation is required by your institution or elsewhere, please complete the application [here](https://forms.office.com/r/mV4WsTcfHn).  We will email the letter to you within 2-3 days.  
The Dominican Republic does not require a visa for anyone who has a valid US, Canadian, UK or Schengen Visa (in addition to being visa free for many countries). If you have questions, please contact your consulate  or embassy. 

## Conference Cancellation Policy
For cancellations received up to two weeks prior to the conference, registration fees will be reimbursed; ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) is not reimbursable.

## ACL 2021 Anti-Harassment Policy
ACL 2021 adheres to the [ACL Anti-Harassment Policy](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Anti-Harassment_Policy). Any participant who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any current member of the [ACL Executive Committee](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/about) or contact [Priscilla Rasmussen](mailto:acl@aclweb.org), who is usually available at the registration desk of the conference. Please be assured that if you approach us, your concerns will be kept in strict confidence, and we will consult with you on any actions taken.
