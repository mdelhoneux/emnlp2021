  title: Registration | EMNLP 2021
---

EMNLP 2021 is currently officially scheduled to be held in hybrid mode, online and in Punta Cana, in the Dominican Republic.  We are currently working on the budget that will set the registration fees.  We expect to have a 2-tier registration form: one will ask if you plan to attend virtually only and this answer will present a virtual registration form and if answering that you plan to attend in-person, a separate in-person registration form will be presented.
 
*We hope to open registration around 10 September so please watch for more details on pricing and registering to be posted here.*

*Reminders*: It is ACLâ€™s policy that at least one author of each accepted paper (including  Finding papers) must register for the conference.

## ACL Membership
The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a current (CY 2021) ACL member. So, in addition to the registration fee, each Regular will add $100 membership fee to their registration and each Student will add $50 membership fee to their registration if not already a 2021 paid member. ACL membership is for the entire calendar year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL and TACL Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in the same year without paying membership again. Membership also entitles you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts on publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and related conferences, workshops, and journal calls of interest to the community.

## Reduced Rate Memberships
The ACL offers a discount to members from developing countries. We hope this discount will allow for more people from these countries to become a part of the ACL and enjoy its benefits. To be able to benefit from reduced rate memberships, you need to become a member through the ACL Member Portal. You can then register for the conference as a current member. For more information follow this link: <https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/membership-fees>

## Conference Cancellation Policy
For cancellations received up to two weeks prior to the conference, registration fees will be reimbursed; ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) is not reimbursable.
