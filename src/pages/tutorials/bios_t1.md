## Alane Suhr  
PhD Student, Cornell University  
<mailto:suhr@cs.cornell.edu>  
<https://alanesuhr.com>  
Alane's research focuses on grounded natural language
understanding. Alane has designed crowdsourcing
tasks for collecting language data to study
situated natural language understanding. Alane
co-presented a tutorial in ACL 2018.

## Clara Vania
Applied Scientist, Amazon  
<mailto:vaniclar@amazon.co.uk>  
<https://claravania.github.io/>  
Her research focuses on crowdsourcing, transfer
learning, and multilingual NLU. Recently, she has
been working on semi-automatic data collection
for natural language inference and crowdsourcing
methods for question answering.

## Nikita Nangia
PhD student, New York University  
<mailto:nikitanangia@nyu.edu>  
<https://woollysocks.github.io>  
Nikita’s work focuses on crowdsourcing methods and data creation for natural language understandingsoft. Her recent work explores using incentive structures to illicit creative examples. Nikita coorganized a tutorial on latent structure models for NLP at ACL 2019.

## Maarten Sap
PhD student, University of Washington  
<mailto:msap@cs.washington.edu>
<http://maartensap.com/>  
His research focuses on endowing NLP systems
with social intelligence and social commonsense,
and understanding social inequality and bias in
language. His substantial experience with crowdsourcing
includes the collecting of the SOCIALIQA
commonsense benchmark as well as the creation
of knowledge graphs with inferential knowledge
(ATOMIC, Social Bias Frames).

## Mark Yatskar
Assistant Professor, University of Pennsylvania  
<mailto:myatskar@seas.upenn.edu>  
<https://markyatskar.com/>  
His research focuses on the intersection of natural
language processing and computer vision. Mark’s
work has resulted in the creation of datasets such as
imSitu, QuAC and WinoBias and recent research
has focused on gender bias in visual recognition
and coreference resolution.

## Sam Bowman
Assistant Professor, New York University  
<mailto:bowman@nyu.edu>  
<https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/>  
Sam works on data creation, benchmarking, and
model analysis for NLU and computational linguistics.
Sam has had a substantial role in several NLU
datasets, including SNLI, MNLI, XNLI, CoLA,
and BLiMP, and his recent work has focused on experimentally
evaluating methods for crowdsourced
corpus construction.

## Yoav Artzi
Associate Professor, Cornell University    
<mailto:yoav@cs.cornell.edu>  
<https://yoavartzi.com/>  
Yoav's research focuses on learning expressive
models for natural language understanding, most
recently in situated interactive scenarios. Yoav
led tutorials on semantic parsing in ACL 2013,
EMNLP 2014 and AAAI 2015.
