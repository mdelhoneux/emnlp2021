Email: <mailto:sebastian@ruder.io>  
Website: <http://ruder.io>  
Sebastian is a research scientist at DeepMind
where he works on transfer learning and multilingual
natural language processing. He has
been area chair in machine learning and multilinguality
for major NLP conferences including
ACL and EMNLP and has published
papers on multilingual question answering
(Artetxe et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020). He was
the Co-Program Chair for EurNLP 2019 and
has co-organized the 4th Workshop on Representation
Learning for NLP at ACL 2019. He
has taught tutorials on "Transfer learning in
natural language processing" and "Unsupervised
Cross-lingual Representation Learning"
at NAACL 2019 and ACL 2019 respectively.
He has also co-organized and taught at the
NLP Session at the Deep Learning Indaba
2018 and 2019.  

Section: Sebastian will teach Multilingual
QA during this tutorial (Second 1 1/2 hrs).
