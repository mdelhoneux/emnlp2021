## Kai-Wei Chang 
Kai-Wei Chang is an assistant
professor in the Department of Computer Science
at the University of California Los Angeles. His research
interests include designing robust, fair, and
accountable machine learning methods for building
reliable NLP systems (e.g., (Alzantot et al., 2018;
Shi et al., 2019)). His awards include the EMNLP
Best Long Paper Award (2017), the KDD Best Paper
Award (2010), and the Sloan Resaerch Fellowship
(2021). Kai-Wei has given tutorials at NAACL
15, AAAI 16, FAccT18, EMNLP 19, AAAI 20,
MLSS 21 on different research topics. Additional
information is available at <http://kwchang.net.>

## He He 
He He is an assistant professor in the Department
of Computer Science and the Center for
Data Science at the New York University. Her research
interests include reliable natural language
generation and robust learning algorithms that
avoid spurious correlations in the data (e.g., (He
et al., 2019; Tu et al., 2020)). She has given tutorials
at NAACL 15 and EMNLP 19. Additional information
is available at <http://hhexiy.github.io.>

## Robin Jia 
Robin Jia is currently a visiting researcher
at Facebook AI Research, and will be an
assistant professor in the Department of Computer
Science at the University of Southern California
starting in the Autumn of 2021. His research focuses
on making natural language processing models
robust to unexpected test-time distribution shifts
(e.g., (Jia and Liang, 2017; Jia et al., 2019). Robinâ€™s
work has received an Outstanding Paper Award at
EMNLP 2017 and a Best Short Paper Award at
ACL 2018. Additional information is available at
<https://robinjia.github.io.>

## Sameer Singh 
Sameer Singh is an Assistant Professor
of Computer Science at the University of
California, Irvine. He is working on large-scale
and interpretable machine learning models for NLP
(e.g., (Wallace et al., 2019a; Pezeshkpour et al.,
2019)). His work has received paper awards at
ACL 2020, AKBC 2020, EMNLP 2019, ACL 2018,
and KDD 2016. Sameer presented the Deep Adversarial
Learning Tutorial (Wang et al., 2019) at
NAACL 2019 and the Mining Knowledge Graphs
from Text Tutorial at WSDM 2018 and AAAI 2017,
along with tutorials on Interpretability and Explanations
in upcoming NeurIPS 2020 and EMNLP 2020. Sameer has also received teaching awards at
UCI. Website: <http://sameersingh.org/>
