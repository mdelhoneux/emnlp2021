## Hai Zhao
Dr. Hai Zhao, Professor, Department of
Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao
Tong University, China.  
<mailto:zhaohai@cs.sjtu.edu.cn>  
<http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~zhaohai>  
His research interest is natural language
processing. He has published more than 120
papers in ACL, EMNLP, COLING, ICLR, AAAI,
IJCAI, and IEEE TKDE/TASLP. He won the
first places in several NLP shared tasks, such as
CoNLL and SIGHAN Bakeoff and top ranking in
remarkable machine reading comprehension task
leaderboards such as SQuAD2.0 and RACE.  
He has taught the course "natural language
processing" in SJTU for more than 10 years. He
is ACL-2017 area chair on parsing, and ACL-
2018/2019 (senior) area chairs on morphology and
word segmentation.

## Rui Wang
Dr. Rui Wang, Tenured Researcher, Advanced
Translation Technology Laboratory, National
Institute of Information and Communications
Technology (NICT), Japan  
<mailto:wangrui.nlp@gmail.com>  
<https://wangruinlp.github.io>  
His research focuses on machine translation
(MT), a classic task in NLP. His recent interests
are traditional linguistic based and cutting-edge
machine learning based approaches for MT. He
(as the first or the corresponding authors) has
published more than 30 MT papers in top-tier
NLP/ML/AI conferences and journals, such as
ACL, EMNLP, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, IEEE/ACM
transactions, etc. He has also won several first
places in top-tier MT shared tasks, such as WMT-
2018, WMT-2019, WMT-2020, etc.  
He has given several tutorial and invited talks in
conferences, such as CWMT, CCL, etc. He served
as the area chairs of ICLR-2021 and NAACL-
2021.

## Kehai Chen
Dr. Kehai Chen, Postdoctoral Researcher,
Advanced Translation Technology Laboratory,
National Institute of Information and Communications
Technology (NICT), Japan  
<mailto:khchen@nict.go.jp>  
<https://chenkehai.github.io>  
His research focuses on linguistic-motivated
machine translation (MT), a classic NLP task in
AI. He has published more than 20 MT and NLP
papers in top-tier NLP/ML/AI conferences and
journals, such as ACL, ICLR, AAAI, EMNLP,
IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and
Language Processing, ACM Transactions on
Asian and Low-Resource Language Information
Processing, etc. He served as a senior program
committee of AAAI-2021.
