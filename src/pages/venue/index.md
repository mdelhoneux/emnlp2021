The physical conference venue is the Barceló Bávaro Convention Centre in the Dominican Republic. A small train will stop periodically throughout the resort to take you from one space to another or take a relaxing stroll along the beach to other parts of the resort.

With its two miles of white sand in the unique and spectacular Bavaro beach, considered one of the top ten best beaches in the world, the Barceló Bávaro Grand Resort is one of the largest, most complete all-inclusive resort complexes in the Caribbean, with two hotels (the Barceló Bávaro Palace and Barceló Bávaro Beach - Adults Only) plus a surprising list of attractions and amenities located on the property.
 
 
The resort is divided into two hotels, Barcelo Bavaro Palace, dedicated and designed for families and the Barceló Bávaro Beach with a concept of "Adults Only". At the Barcelo Bavaro Palace section, you’ll find excellent cuisine with 11 restaurants to choose from, including 7 à la carte restaurants and 2 themed buffets, each a unique dining experience where you will be transported to different parts of the world, from the tradition minimalist Japanese cuisine to the exciting flavors and colors of Mexico, through the unique experiences of the Spanish or Italian cuisine, not forgetting the delicious Dominican food in a stunning buffet dedicated to this specialty, also the fun and atmosphere of a Steak House. For guests of the Barceló Bávaro Beach, two buffets and two à la carte Restaurants International and Mediterranean are located nearby but, of course, everyone can enjoy any of the restaurants.
 
Plus you are welcome to take advantage of the resort facilities which include the beach and various water sports; enjoy spectacular shows to Caribbean rhythms and a nightclub; bowling, golf, shopping and multiple pools,or relax in the modern facilities of its center of beauty and wellness,  just to name some of the things offered to delight each visitor.  And childcare can also be arranged if needed.
